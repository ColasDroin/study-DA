# Case studies

The case studies in this section should provide you with almost ready-to-use solutions for your own projects. They are designed to be very generic, such that you should be able to use them as a starting point for your own projects.

They also contain a lot of comments to help you understand what is going on in the code, and do complement nicely the [tutorials](../tutorials/index.md) section, as many tweaks and improvements to simulations are discussed there.
